# Python 3.11 Minimum Version Consistency

## Overview

This spec addresses inconsistent Python version requirements across the Slide monorepo that were causing installation failures for users with Python 3.11 and 3.12.

## Status: ✅ COMPLETED

All changes have been implemented and are ready for release.

## Problem Summary

A user reported installation failures when trying to install Slide packages:
```
× No solution found when resolving dependencies:
  Because the requested Python version (>=3.11) does not satisfy Python>=3.13 
  and slide-tyler<=2.0.6 depends on Python>=3.13, we can conclude that 
  slide-tyler cannot be used.
```

**Root Cause**: 
- Packages specified `requires-python = ">=3.13"` in metadata
- Actual code requirement is `>=3.11` (uses `datetime.UTC` added in Python 3.11)
- Documentation incorrectly stated Python 3.13 as minimum
- No Python 3.12+ or 3.13+ specific features were actually used

## Investigation Findings

### Code Analysis
- Searched for Python version-specific features
- Found extensive use of `datetime.UTC` (72+ occurrences)
- Confirmed `datetime.UTC` was added in Python 3.11
- No `match` statements or Python 3.12+ syntax found
- All dependencies (litellm, openai, pydantic) support Python 3.8+

### Actual Minimum Version: **Python 3.11**

## Changes Implemented

### 1. Package Metadata (4 files)
- [x] `packages/tyler/pyproject.toml`: `>=3.13` → `>=3.11`, added 3.11 classifier
- [x] `packages/lye/pyproject.toml`: `>=3.13` → `>=3.11`, added 3.11 classifier
- [x] `packages/space-monkey/pyproject.toml`: `>=3.13` → `>=3.11`
- [x] `packages/narrator/pyproject.toml`: Already correct at `>=3.11`

### 2. Documentation (4 files)
- [x] `README.md`: Updated from "Python 3.13+" to "Python 3.11+"
- [x] `docs/quickstart.mdx`: Updated requirements and troubleshooting
- [x] `docs/guides/your-first-agent.mdx`: Added Python 3.11 requirement note
- [x] `directive/reference/agent_context.md`: Updated from "3.13+" to "3.11+"

### 3. Code Generation (1 file)
- [x] `packages/tyler/tyler/cli/init.py`: Template now generates `>=3.11` (was `>=3.12`)

### 4. CI/CD Workflows (2 files)
- [x] `.github/workflows/test.yml`: Add Python version matrix (3.11, 3.12, 3.13)
- [x] `.github/workflows/test-examples.yml`: Add Python version matrix

## Testing Strategy

### CI Matrix Testing
All test workflows now use Python version matrix testing:
- Tests run on Python 3.11, 3.12, and 3.13 for every PR
- Ensures compatibility claims are verified automatically
- Prevents version-specific regressions

**Coverage:**
- ✅ Python 3.11 - Automated in CI
- ✅ Python 3.12 - Automated in CI  
- ✅ Python 3.13 - Automated in CI

## Release Plan

### Version Bumps (Patch releases)
- `slide-tyler`: 2.1.0 → 2.1.1
- `slide-lye`: 1.0.1 → 1.0.2
- `slide-narrator`: 1.0.2 → 1.0.3
- `slide-space-monkey`: 1.0.0 → 1.0.1

### Release Notes Template
```markdown
## Changed
- Relaxed Python version requirement from 3.13+ to 3.11+ to reflect actual code dependencies

## Fixed
- Installation errors for users with Python 3.11 or 3.12
- Documentation inconsistencies regarding minimum Python version
```

## Impact

### Users Affected
**Positive Impact:**
- Users with Python 3.11 or 3.12 can now install Slide packages
- Clearer, more accurate documentation
- Consistent experience across all packages

**No Negative Impact:**
- Users on Python 3.13 are unaffected
- This is a constraint relaxation, not a restriction
- No breaking changes to APIs or behavior

### Compatibility Matrix

| Python Version | Before This Change | After This Change |
|----------------|-------------------|-------------------|
| 3.10 and below | ❌ Not supported  | ❌ Not supported  |
| 3.11           | ❌ Install failed | ✅ Fully supported |
| 3.12           | ❌ Install failed | ✅ Fully supported |
| 3.13           | ✅ Supported      | ✅ Supported      |

- [Impact Analysis](./impact.md) - Detailed impact assessment and testing plan

## Notes

- All acceptance criteria from spec have been met
- No TDR required (metadata, documentation, and CI configuration changes only)
- No code logic changes, only metadata, documentation, and CI workflow updates
- CI matrix testing ensures all supported versions are verified on every PR

## Future Considerations

### Python 3.10 Support (If Requested)
- Would require replacing `datetime.UTC` with `datetime.timezone.utc` (available in 3.10)
- Only implement if there's significant user demand
- Estimated effort: Low (simple find/replace across ~72 occurrences)
