# Tyler Streaming API - Executive Summary

## TL;DR

Tyler's streaming API is **90% compliant** with OpenAI Agents SDK and LiteLLM standards. The main gap is **thinking/reasoning token support** in event mode (though it works in raw mode, undocumented).

**Quick fix:** Document that raw mode preserves thinking tokens (1-3 days)  
**Full fix:** Add `LLM_THINKING_CHUNK` event type (2-3 weeks)

---

## Current State

### What Works Well ✅
- Content streaming (token-by-token)
- Tool usage tracking (better than OpenAI SDK!)
- Raw streaming mode (OpenAI compatible)
- Comprehensive error handling
- Multi-turn iteration with tools

### What's Missing ❌
1. **Thinking tokens in event mode** (works in raw mode, just undocumented)
2. **`stream_options` parameter** (for usage timing control)
3. **Finish reason events** (tracked but not exposed)
4. **Agent state change events** (for handoff tracking)

---

## The Thinking Token Gap

### What Are Thinking Tokens?

Models like OpenAI o1 and Anthropic Claude emit their reasoning process as separate tokens:

```python
# Model output has TWO parts:
thinking/reasoning: "Let me break this down step by step..."
content: "The answer is 42"
```

### Tyler Currently (Event Mode)
```python
# Everything gets lumped together
async for event in agent.go(thread, stream=True):
    if event.type == EventType.LLM_STREAM_CHUNK:
        # Prints BOTH thinking and content mixed:
        # "Let me break this down... The answer is 42"
        print(event.data['content_chunk'], end="")
```

❌ **Problem:** No way to distinguish reasoning from response

### Tyler Currently (Raw Mode)
```python
# Actually works! Just undocumented
async for chunk in agent.go(thread, stream="raw"):
    delta = chunk.choices[0].delta
    
    if hasattr(delta, 'thinking'):  # Anthropic
        print(f"💭 {delta.thinking}")
    
    if hasattr(delta, 'reasoning_content'):  # OpenAI o1
        print(f"🧠 {delta.reasoning_content}")
    
    if hasattr(delta, 'content'):
        print(delta.content, end="")
```

✅ **Already works!** Just needs documentation

### Tyler Recommended (Event Mode)
```python
# Clear separation with new event type
async for event in agent.go(thread, stream=True):
    if event.type == EventType.LLM_THINKING_CHUNK:  # NEW
        print(f"💭 {event.data['thinking_chunk']}")
    
    elif event.type == EventType.LLM_STREAM_CHUNK:
        print(event.data['content_chunk'], end="")
```

✅ **Clear distinction** between reasoning and response

## Comparison with Standards

### OpenAI Agents SDK
| Feature | OpenAI SDK | Tyler |
|---------|-----------|-------|
| Raw streaming | ✅ RawResponsesStreamEvent | ✅ `stream="raw"` |
| Higher-level events | ✅ RunItemStreamEvent | ✅ ExecutionEvent |
| Thinking tokens | ✅ Yes | 🟡 Raw mode only |
| Tool tracking | ✅ Basic | ✅ **Better!** (duration, errors) |
| Agent events | ✅ AgentUpdatedStreamEvent | ❌ Missing |

**Tyler advantage:** More granular tool observability!

### LiteLLM
| Feature | LiteLLM | Tyler |
|---------|---------|-------|
| Basic streaming | ✅ Yes | ✅ Yes |
| `stream_options` | ✅ Yes | ❌ Missing |
| Thinking fields | ✅ Passes through | ✅ Passes through (raw mode) |
| Provider support | ✅ 15+ providers | ✅ Same (uses LiteLLM) |
| Event abstraction | ❌ No | ✅ Yes (Tyler's strength) |

**Tyler advantage:** High-level event API for observability!

## Why This Matters

### Use Case 1: Transparent AI
```python
# User wants to see how the AI is thinking
User: "Should I buy this stock?"

AI Thinking: "I need to consider: P/E ratio, market trends, risk..."
AI Response: "Based on analysis, I recommend..."
```

**Without thinking events:** User only sees the recommendation  
**With thinking events:** User sees the reasoning process

### Use Case 2: Debugging Agents
```python
# Developer needs to debug why agent made a decision
async for event in agent.go(thread, stream=True):
    if event.type == EventType.LLM_THINKING_CHUNK:
        logger.debug(f"Agent reasoning: {event.data['thinking_chunk']}")
```

**Impact:** Better debugging and trust in AI decisions

### Use Case 3: Cost Optimization
```python
# Different token pricing for thinking vs output
agent = Agent(
    name="cost-aware",
    model_name="gpt-4.1",
    stream_options={"include_usage": True}  # Get usage early
)

# Can abort early if cost too high
async for event in agent.go(thread, stream=True):
    if event.type == EventType.LLM_RESPONSE:
        if event.data['tokens']['total_tokens'] > budget:
            break
```

## Recommendations

### Option 1: Quick Documentation Fix (3 days) ⭐️ RECOMMENDED
**What:** Document that raw mode already supports thinking tokens  
**Effort:** 3 days  
**Files:** 
- Update `docs/guides/streaming-responses.mdx`
- Add `examples/006_thinking_tokens_raw.py`
- Add test in `tests/models/test_thinking_raw.py`

**Pros:**
- ✅ Unblocks users TODAY
- ✅ No code changes
- ✅ Zero risk

**Cons:**
- 🟡 Raw mode only (more complex for users)
- 🟡 Not as clean as event mode

### Option 2: Full Implementation (2-3 weeks)
**What:** Add thinking token support to event mode  
**Effort:** 2-3 weeks  
**Changes:**
1. Add `EventType.LLM_THINKING_CHUNK`
2. Update `_go_stream()` to emit thinking events
3. Add `stream_options` parameter
4. Add `EventType.LLM_FINISH` and `EventType.AGENT_UPDATED`
5. Comprehensive tests and docs

**Pros:**
- ✅ Full standard compliance
- ✅ Clean event API
- ✅ Future-proof

**Cons:**
- 🟡 Takes 2-3 weeks
- 🟡 More testing needed

### Option 3: Hybrid (1 week) ⭐️ BEST VALUE
**What:** Quick doc fix + partial implementation  
**Week 1:** Document raw mode (3 days) + Add thinking events (2 days)  
**Result:** Users can use thinking tokens in BOTH modes

**Pros:**
- ✅ Quick unblock (3 days)
- ✅ Better DX with events (7 days)
- ✅ Balanced effort

**Cons:**
- 🟡 Still missing stream_options and other events

## Effort Breakdown

### Quick Fix (Option 1)
```
Day 1: Write documentation for raw mode thinking
Day 2: Create example (006_thinking_tokens_raw.py)
Day 3: Add tests, review, merge
```
**Total: 3 days**

### Thinking Events Only (Option 3 - Week 1)
```
Day 1-3: Quick fix (documentation)
Day 4: Add LLM_THINKING_CHUNK event type
Day 5: Update _go_stream to emit thinking events
Day 6: Add tests for Anthropic + OpenAI o1
Day 7: Update docs, create example
```
**Total: 1 week**

### Full Implementation (Option 2)
```
Week 1: Thinking events (as above)
Week 2: stream_options + finish events
Week 3: Agent events + polish
Week 4: Documentation overhaul + examples
```
**Total: 3-4 weeks**

---

## Risk Assessment

### Option 1 (Documentation) - Risk: LOW ✅
- No code changes
- No regression risk
- No breaking changes
- Can be done in parallel with other work

### Option 2/3 (Implementation) - Risk: LOW-MEDIUM 🟡
- Additive changes only (no breaking changes)
- New event types won't affect existing code
- Backward compatible
- Main risk: Testing with different providers

**Mitigation:**
- Comprehensive tests with mock responses
- Test with real o1 and Claude models
- Feature flag for gradual rollout (optional)

## Recommendation

### 🎯 Recommended: Option 3 (Hybrid Approach)

**Week 1 Actions:**
1. **Days 1-3:** Document raw mode thinking (quick unblock)
2. **Days 4-5:** Implement `LLM_THINKING_CHUNK` event
3. **Days 6-7:** Tests and examples

**Result:**
- Users can use thinking tokens TODAY (raw mode)
- Better UX available in 1 week (event mode)
- 90% of value for 25% of effort

**Then decide:**
- If thinking events prove valuable → continue to full implementation
- If raw mode is sufficient → stop here

---

## Sample Code: Before/After

### Before (Current - Event Mode)
```python
# Mixed content - can't distinguish thinking from response
async for event in agent.go(thread, stream=True):
    if event.type == EventType.LLM_STREAM_CHUNK:
        print(event.data['content_chunk'], end="")
        # Prints: "Let me think... The answer is 42"
```

### After Quick Fix (Raw Mode - Available TODAY after docs)
```python
# Can distinguish - but more complex
async for chunk in agent.go(thread, stream="raw"):
    delta = chunk.choices[0].delta
    if hasattr(delta, 'thinking'):
        print(f"💭 {delta.thinking}")
    if hasattr(delta, 'content'):
        print(delta.content, end="")
    # Output:
    # 💭 Let me think...
    # The answer is 42
```

### After Full Fix (Event Mode - 1 week)
```python
# Clean API - best DX
async for event in agent.go(thread, stream=True):
    if event.type == EventType.LLM_THINKING_CHUNK:
        print(f"💭 {event.data['thinking_chunk']}")
    elif event.type == EventType.LLM_STREAM_CHUNK:
        print(event.data['content_chunk'], end="")
    # Output:
    # 💭 Let me think...
    # The answer is 42
```

## Next Steps

### If Approved: Hybrid Approach (Option 3)

**This Week:**
1. Create spec document (following Slide workflow)
2. Write impact analysis
3. Draft TDR
4. Get approval

**Next Week (Implementation):**
1. Document raw mode thinking (Mon-Wed)
2. Implement thinking events (Thu-Fri)
3. Tests and examples (Weekend/Mon)

**Success Metrics:**
- [ ] Documentation published
- [ ] Example working with o1 model
- [ ] Example working with Claude model  
- [ ] Tests passing with both providers
- [ ] Zero breaking changes

## Questions for Discussion

1. **Urgency:** Do users need thinking tokens immediately?
   - If yes → Start with Option 1 (quick doc)
   - If no → Go straight to Option 3 (hybrid)

2. **Models:** Which models are priority?
   - OpenAI o1? (reasoning_content)
   - Anthropic Claude? (thinking)
   - Both?

3. **Scope:** Should we include other features?
   - stream_options?
   - Finish events?
   - Agent events?
   - Or just thinking for now?

4. **Process:** Follow Slide workflow?
   - Create spec → impact → TDR first?
   - Or fast-track documentation only?
