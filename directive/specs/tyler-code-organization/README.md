# Tyler Code Organization & Maintainability Refactor

This directory contains the specification, impact analysis, and technical design for refactoring Tyler's internal architecture.

## Overview

This refactor addresses technical debt in the Tyler package by:
- Splitting the 1,598-line Agent class into focused, single-responsibility components
- Eliminating ~70% code duplication between streaming and non-streaming implementations
- Simplifying tool registration with a strategy pattern
- Improving testability and maintainability

**Key Principle**: ✅ **Zero breaking changes** - 100% backward compatibility maintained

## Documents

### 1. [Spec](./spec.md)
The product specification outlining:
- Problem statement and goals
- User stories and acceptance criteria
- Requirements and success metrics
- What's in scope and out of scope

### 2. [Impact Analysis](./impact.md)
Assessment of:
- Modules and files affected
- Risk analysis (security, performance, data integrity)
- Observability and monitoring needs
- Rollout and rollback strategy

### 3. [Technical Design Review (TDR)](./tdr.md)
Detailed technical design including:
- Architecture overview and component diagrams
- Interface definitions and contracts
- Test strategy and coverage plan
- Phased implementation plan (8 phases over 4-5 weeks)
- Performance targets and benchmarks

## Approval Process

Following the Slide development workflow:

1. ✅ **Spec**: Define what and why
2. ✅ **Impact**: Assess risks and scope
3. ✅ **TDR**: Design how it will work
4. 🔴 **Approval**: All three documents must be approved before coding
5. ⏳ **Implementation**: Proceed in phases with tests

## Quick Reference

### Key Metrics
- **Current Agent class size**: 1,598 lines
- **Target Agent class size**: <500 lines (75% reduction)
- **Code duplication**: ~70% between streaming/non-streaming
- **Target duplication**: <20%
- **Test coverage**: ≥80% (maintain or improve)
- **Performance tolerance**: ±5%

### Implementation Phases

1. **Foundation** (Days 1-2): Benchmarks, baseline, architecture
2. **ToolCall Normalization** (Days 3-4): Value object pattern
3. **MessageFactory** (Days 5-7): Extract message creation
4. **Tool Strategies** (Days 8-11): Strategy pattern for registration
5. **CompletionHandler** (Days 12-14): Extract LLM communication
6. **Streaming Consolidation** (Days 15-19): ⚠️ HIGH RISK - Reduce duplication
7. **ToolRunner Restructure** (Days 20-22): Split into focused modules
8. **Documentation** (Days 23-25): Polish and finalize

### Success Criteria
- ✅ All existing tests pass unchanged
- ✅ No breaking changes to public APIs
- ✅ Performance within 5% of baseline
- ✅ Code complexity metrics improve
- ✅ Test coverage maintained or improved

## Testing Strategy

### Test Requirements
- **Unit Tests**: New tests for each extracted component
- **Integration Tests**: All existing tests must pass
- **Performance Tests**: Benchmarks at each phase
- **Coverage**: Must remain ≥80%

### Test-First Approach
1. Ensure all tests pass before refactoring
2. Add tests for any discovered gaps
3. Refactor code
4. Verify all tests still pass
5. Repeat

## Branch and Development

**Branch**: `refactor/tyler-code-organization`

**Development Rules**:
- ✅ All tests must pass before merging each phase
- ✅ No skipping or disabling tests
- ✅ Performance benchmarks must validate each phase
- ✅ Code review required for each phase
