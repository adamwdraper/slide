Tyler Refactoring - Baseline Metrics
=====================================
Captured: 2025-01-11
Branch: refactor/tyler-code-organization
Commit: 72ba3b3

TEST RESULTS
------------
Status: ‚úÖ ALL TESTS PASSING
Tests Passed: 215
Tests Skipped: 32
Warnings: 10,606 (mostly deprecation warnings from dependencies)
Execution Time: 20.90s
Environment: Python 3.13.5, pytest 8.4.1, uv

COVERAGE METRICS
----------------
Overall Coverage: 59%

Key Modules to Refactor:
- tyler/models/agent.py: 84% ‚úÖ (Target: maintain ‚â•80%)
- tyler/utils/tool_runner.py: 84% ‚úÖ (Target: maintain ‚â•80%)
- tyler/models/execution.py: 100% ‚úÖ (Target: maintain 100%)
- tyler/mcp/adapter.py: 87% ‚úÖ (Target: maintain ‚â•80%)

Note: Overall coverage is lower due to:
- CLI tools (0% - not run in automated tests)
- A2A modules (13-21% - limited test coverage)
- Example files (varying coverage)
- Some utility modules (0%)

Core modules have excellent coverage for safe refactoring!

FILE SIZE METRICS
-----------------
tyler/models/agent.py: 1598 lines ‚ö†Ô∏è (Target: <500 lines)
tyler/utils/tool_runner.py: 348 lines (Target: maintain or reduce)
tyler/models/execution.py: 52 lines ‚úÖ (No change planned)
tyler/mcp/adapter.py: 227 lines (Minor improvements)
tyler/a2a/adapter.py: 359 lines (Minor improvements)

CODE QUALITY OBSERVATIONS
--------------------------
‚úÖ All tests passing - clean baseline
‚úÖ Core modules well-tested (‚â•84% coverage)
‚ö†Ô∏è Large Agent class (1598 lines) - primary refactor target
‚ö†Ô∏è Duplication in streaming logic (~70% overlap)
‚ö†Ô∏è Complex tool registration logic (nested conditionals)

PERFORMANCE BASELINE
--------------------
Test Suite Execution: 20.90s
Status: ‚è≥ Need to create detailed performance benchmarks

To create:
- Agent initialization time
- Tool registration time  
- Message creation time
- Tool execution time
- Streaming vs non-streaming performance
- Memory usage metrics

FILES GENERATED
---------------
‚úÖ baseline-test-results.txt - Full pytest output
‚úÖ baseline-coverage.txt - Coverage report  
‚úÖ htmlcov/ - HTML coverage report
‚úÖ baseline-summary.txt - This file

NEXT STEPS
----------
1. ‚úÖ Tests baseline captured
2. ‚úÖ Coverage metrics documented
3. ‚è≥ Create performance benchmarks (Phase 1 remaining)
4. ‚è≥ Begin Phase 2: ToolCall normalization

APPROVAL STATUS
---------------
‚úÖ Spec reviewed and approved
‚úÖ Impact analysis reviewed and approved  
‚úÖ TDR reviewed and approved
‚úÖ Clean test baseline established
‚úÖ Coverage meets requirements (core modules ‚â•80%)

Ready to proceed with refactoring! üöÄ
