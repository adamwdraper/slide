**Build an agent with just a few lines of code.**

```python
from tyler import Agent, Thread, Message
from lye import WEB_TOOLS, IMAGE_TOOLS

# Create a powerful AI agent
agent = Agent(
    name="assistant",
    model_name="gpt-4o",
    purpose="To help with research and analysis",
    tools=[*WEB_TOOLS, *IMAGE_TOOLS]
)

# Use your agent
thread = Thread()
message = Message(role="user", content="Research the latest AI breakthroughs")
thread.add_message(message)

processed_thread, new_messages = await agent.go(thread)
```

That's it! Your agent can now search the web, analyze images, and complete complex tasks autonomously.

<summary>ðŸ§© Advanced: Using Slide's Modular Architecture</summary>

While most users will want the full agent experience, Slide is built as modular packages that can be used independently:

- **Tyler**: Core agent framework
- **Lye**: Tool library 
- **Narrator**: Conversation memory
- **Space Monkey**: Slack integration
