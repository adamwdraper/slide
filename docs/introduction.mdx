**Build an agent with just a few lines of code.**

```python
import asyncio
from tyler import Agent, Thread, Message, EventType
from lye import WEB_TOOLS

# Create an AI agent that can browse the web
agent = Agent(
    name="web_summarizer",
    model_name="gpt-4o",
    purpose="To summarize web content clearly and concisely",
    tools=WEB_TOOLS
)

# Ask your agent to visit and summarize a webpage
thread = Thread()
thread.add_message(Message(
    role="user", 
    content="Why should I use https://slide.mintlify.app/?"
))

# Watch your agent work in real-time
async def main():
    async for event in agent.stream(thread):
        # Print content as it's generated
        if event.type == EventType.LLM_STREAM_CHUNK:
            print(event.data['content_chunk'], end="", flush=True)
        # Show when tools are being used
        elif event.type == EventType.TOOL_SELECTED:
            print(f"\n🔧 Using {event.data['tool_name']}...")

asyncio.run(main())
```

That's it! Your agent can now search the web, analyze images, and complete complex tasks autonomously—and you can watch it happen in real-time.

## Why use Slide?

Slide gives you everything you need to build, test, and deploy intelligent AI agents. It is:

- **Extensible and open source**: Built on a foundation you can inspect, customize, and contribute to
- **Flexible with model support**: Compatible with any LLM provider supported by LiteLLM (100+ providers including OpenAI, Anthropic, etc.)
- **MCP and A2A compatible**: Seamlessly integrated with Model Context Protocol (MCP) servers and Agent-to-Agent (A2A) protocol for multi-agent interoperability
- **Agent delegation built-in**: Create multi-agent systems where specialized agents collaborate to solve complex tasks
- **Multimodal by design**: Capable of processing and understanding images, audio, PDFs, and more out of the box
- **Persistent with conversations**: Equipped with built-in support for threads, messages, and attachments with flexible storage options (in-memory, SQLite, or PostgreSQL)
- **Ready-to-use with tools**: Packed with built-in tools for web interaction, file handling, and browser automation with support for custom tools
- **Real-time streaming enabled**: Designed to build interactive applications with streaming responses from both agents and tools
- **Transparent reasoning**: Access model thinking tokens from OpenAI o1 and Anthropic Claude to see how agents arrive at decisions
- **Interactive CLI included**: Chat with your agents instantly using the built-in `tyler chat` command, or scaffold new projects with `tyler init`
- **Evaluation-ready**: Equipped with a framework to test agents safely with mock tools, prebuilt LLM judges, and multi-turn conversation scenarios
- **Debuggable**: Integrated with W&B Weave for powerful tracing and debugging capabilities

<summary>🧩 Advanced: Using Slide's Modular Architecture</summary>

While most users will want the full agent experience, Slide is built as modular packages that can be used independently:

- **Tyler**: Core agent framework
- **Lye**: Tool library 
- **Narrator**: Conversation persistence
- **Space Monkey**: Slack integration
