Slide makes it easy to start building effective AI agents in just a few lines of code. Whether you're creating autonomous assistants, building Slack bots, or developing complex multi-agent systems, Slide provides all the essential components needed to build production-ready AI applications that can understand context, manage conversations, and effectively use tools.

### Key Features

- **Multimodal support**: Process and understand images, audio, PDFs, and more out of the box
- **Flexible model support**: Use any LLM provider supported by LiteLLM (100+ providers including OpenAI, Anthropic, etc.)
- **MCP compatibility**: Seamless integration with Model Context Protocol (MCP) compatible servers and tools
- **Ready-to-use tools**: Basic set of built-in tools for web interaction, file handling, and browser automation with support for custom tools
- **Real-time streaming**: Build interactive applications with streaming responses from both agents and tools
- **Structured data model**: Built-in support for threads, messages, and attachments to maintain conversation context
- **Persistent storage**: Choose between in-memory, SQLite, or PostgreSQL to store conversation history and files
- **Production testing**: Comprehensive evaluation framework with mock tools for safe agent testing
- **Advanced debugging**: Integration with W&B Weave for powerful tracing and debugging capabilities

## The Slide Ecosystem

Slide consists of four independent packages that are designed to work seamlessly together, but each can be used on its own:

## Quick Example

Here's how the components work together (or separately):

```python
# Use Tyler alone for simple agents
from tyler import Agent, Thread, Message

agent = Agent(
    name="assistant", 
    model_name="gpt-4",
    purpose="To be a helpful assistant"
)

# Create a thread and add a message
thread = Thread()
message = Message(role="user", content="Hello!")
thread.add_message(message)

# Process the conversation
processed_thread, new_messages = await agent.go(thread)

# Add Lye for tool capabilities
from tyler import Agent
from lye import WEB_TOOLS, IMAGE_TOOLS
from lye.audio import transcribe

agent = Agent(
    name="researcher",
    model_name="gpt-4",
    purpose="To help with research tasks",
    tools=[
        *WEB_TOOLS,      # All web tools
        *IMAGE_TOOLS,    # All image tools
        transcribe       # Specific audio tool
    ]
)

# Add Narrator for persistent storage
from tyler import Agent, ThreadStore, FileStore

# Create persistent stores
thread_store = await ThreadStore.create("sqlite+aiosqlite:///threads.db")
file_store = await FileStore.create(base_path="./stored_files")

agent = Agent(
    name="persistent-assistant",
    model_name="gpt-4",
    thread_store=thread_store,
    file_store=file_store
)

# Or use all together for maximum power
from tyler import Agent, ThreadStore, FileStore
from lye import WEB_TOOLS, AUDIO_TOOLS, IMAGE_TOOLS

# Set up persistent storage
thread_store = await ThreadStore.create("postgresql://...")
file_store = await FileStore.create(base_path="./files")

agent = Agent(
    name="full-featured-assistant",
    model_name="gpt-4",
    purpose="To be a comprehensive AI assistant",
    tools=[*WEB_TOOLS, *AUDIO_TOOLS, *IMAGE_TOOLS],
    thread_store=thread_store,
    file_store=file_store
)
```
