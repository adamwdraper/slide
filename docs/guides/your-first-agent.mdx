---

In this guide, we'll build a research assistant agent that can search the web, analyze information, and create reports. By the end, you'll understand the core concepts of building agents with Slide.

## What We're Building

We'll create an agent that can:
- Search for information on any topic
- Analyze and summarize findings
- Save research reports to files
- Remember previous conversations

<Steps>
  <Step title="Set Up Your Project">
    First, create a new project directory:

    ```bash
    mkdir research-agent
    cd research-agent
    ```

    Install the required packages:

    <Tabs>
      <Tab title="uv (Recommended)">
        ```bash
        # Initialize project with uv
        uv init .
        
        # Add Slide packages
        uv add slide-tyler slide-lye slide-narrator
        ```
      </Tab>
      <Tab title="pip">
        ```bash
        # Create virtual environment
        python -m venv venv
        source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
        
        # Install packages
        pip install slide-tyler slide-lye slide-narrator
        ```
      </Tab>
    </Tabs>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Create Your First Agent">
    Create a file called `agent.py`:

    ```python
    import asyncio
    from tyler import Agent, Thread, Message
    from lye import WEB_TOOLS, FILES_TOOLS

    async def main():
        # Create your agent
        agent = Agent(
            name="research-assistant",
            model_name="gpt-4o",
            purpose="To help with research by finding, analyzing, and summarizing information",
            tools=[
                *WEB_TOOLS,     # Can search and fetch web content
                *FILES_TOOLS    # Can read and write files
            ]
        )
        # Create a conversation thread
        thread = Thread()
        
        # Add a user message
        message = Message(
            role="user",
            content="Research the latest developments in renewable energy and create a summary report"
        )
        thread.add_message(message)
        
        # Let the agent work
        print("🔍 Researching renewable energy...")
        processed_thread, new_messages = await agent.go(thread)
        
        # Print the results
        for msg in new_messages:
            if msg.role == "assistant":
                print(f"\n💬 Assistant: {msg.content}")
            elif msg.role == "tool":
                print(f"\n🔧 Used {msg.name}")

    if __name__ == "__main__":
        asyncio.run(main())
    ```
  </Step>

  <Step title="Run Your Agent">
    <Tabs>
      <Tab title="uv">
        ```bash
        uv run agent.py
        ```
      </Tab>
      <Tab title="python">
        ```bash
        python agent.py
        ```
      </Tab>
    </Tabs>

    When you run the agent, here's what happens:

    1. **Thread Creation**: A conversation thread is created to hold messages
    2. **Message Processing**: The agent receives your message and plans its approach
    3. **Tool Usage**: The agent uses web search tools to find information
    4. **Response Generation**: The agent synthesizes findings into a response
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Understanding What Happened

Let's add some visibility into the agent's process:

```python
# Enhanced version with detailed output
async def main():
    thread = Thread()
    message = Message(
        role="user",
        content="What are the top 3 renewable energy breakthroughs in 2024?"
    )
    thread.add_message(message)
    
    print("🤖 Agent is thinking...")
    processed_thread, new_messages = await agent.go(thread)
    
    # Show the complete conversation
    print("\n=== Complete Conversation ===")
    for msg in processed_thread.messages:
        if msg.role == "user":
            print(f"\n👤 User: {msg.content}")
        elif msg.role == "assistant":
            print(f"\n🤖 Assistant: {msg.content}")
        elif msg.role == "tool":
            print(f"\n🔧 Tool [{msg.name}]: {msg.content[:100]}...")
```

## Add Persistence to Your Agent

Let's upgrade the agent to maintain conversation history:

```python
import asyncio
from tyler import Agent, Thread, Message, ThreadStore, FileStore
from lye import WEB_TOOLS, FILES_TOOLS

async def create_agent_with_persistence():
    # Set up persistent storage
    thread_store = await ThreadStore.create("sqlite+aiosqlite:///research.db")
    file_store = await FileStore.create(base_path="./research_files")
    
    # Create agent with persistence
    agent = Agent(
        name="research-assistant",
        model_name="gpt-4",
        purpose="To help with research and maintain our conversation history",
        tools=[*WEB_TOOLS, *FILES_TOOLS],
        thread_store=thread_store,
        file_store=file_store
    )
    
    return agent, thread_store

async def main():
    agent, thread_store = await create_agent_with_persistence()
    
    # Try to resume previous conversation
    thread_id = "main-research"
    try:
        thread = await thread_store.get_thread(thread_id)
        print("📚 Resuming previous research session...")
        print(f"   Found {len(thread.messages)} previous messages")
    except:
        thread = Thread(id=thread_id)
        print("🆕 Starting new research session...")
    
    # Add new message
    message = Message(
        role="user",
        content="What did we discuss last time? If this is our first conversation, tell me about yourself."
    )
    thread.add_message(message)
    
    # Process
    processed_thread, new_messages = await agent.go(thread)
    
    # Save the conversation
    await thread_store.save_thread(processed_thread)
    
    # Print response
    for msg in new_messages:
        if msg.role == "assistant":
            print(f"\n🤖 {msg.content}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    asyncio.run(main())
```

## Interactive Research Session

Let's create an interactive version where you can have a conversation:

```python
async def interactive_session():
    agent, thread_store = await create_agent_with_persistence()
    
    # Load or create thread
    thread_id = "interactive-research"
    try:
        thread = await thread_store.get_thread(thread_id)
        print("📚 Resuming previous session...")
    except:
        thread = Thread(id=thread_id)
        print("🆕 Starting new session...")
        print("💡 Try asking me to research any topic!")
    
    print("\nType 'exit' to end the session\n")
    
    while True:
        # Get user input
        user_input = input("You: ")
        if user_input.lower() in ['exit', 'quit']:
            break
        
        # Add message to thread
        message = Message(role="user", content=user_input)
        thread.add_message(message)
        
        # Process with agent
        print("\n🤖 Thinking...", end="", flush=True)
        processed_thread, new_messages = await agent.go(thread)
        
        # Clear thinking message
        print("\r" + " " * 20 + "\r", end="")
        
        # Display response
        for msg in new_messages:
            if msg.role == "assistant":
                print(f"🤖 Assistant: {msg.content}\n")
            elif msg.role == "tool":
                print(f"   [Used {msg.name}]")
        
        # Save conversation
        await thread_store.save_thread(processed_thread)
        thread = processed_thread
    
    print("\n👋 Session saved. See you next time!")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    asyncio.run(interactive_session())
```

## Understanding Tools

Let's explore what tools your agent can use:

```python
# See available tools
from lye import WEB_TOOLS, FILES_TOOLS, IMAGE_TOOLS

print("🔧 Web Tools:")
for tool in WEB_TOOLS:
    print(f"   - {tool['definition']['name']}: {tool['definition']['description']}")

print("\n📁 File Tools:")
for tool in FILES_TOOLS:
    print(f"   - {tool['definition']['name']}: {tool['definition']['description']}")
```

You can also give your agent specific tools:

```python
from lye.web import search, fetch
from lye.files import write_file

agent = Agent(
    name="focused-researcher",
    model_name="gpt-4",
    purpose="To search and save information",
    tools=[search, fetch, write_file]  # Only these specific tools
)
```


## Debugging Your Agent

### Basic Logging

Enable detailed logging to see what your agent is doing:

```python
import logging

# Enable debug logging
logging.basicConfig(level=logging.INFO)
```

### Advanced Tracing with Weave

For comprehensive debugging and observability, Slide integrates with [Weights & Biases Weave](https://weave-docs.wandb.ai/). Weave provides:

- **Visual traces** of every agent action and decision
- **LLM call tracking** with inputs, outputs, and token usage
- **Tool execution monitoring** to see which tools were called and their results
- **Performance insights** to identify bottlenecks
- **Error tracking** with full context

```python
import weave

# Initialize Weave tracing
weave.init("my-research-agent")

# Now all agent operations will be traced automatically
# View traces at https://wandb.ai/your-username/my-research-agent
```

<Tip>
  Weave traces are invaluable for debugging complex agent behaviors. You can see exactly what prompts were sent to the LLM, what tools were called, and how the agent made its decisions.

## Tips for Success

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Clear Purpose Statements">
    The `purpose` parameter significantly affects agent behavior. Be specific:
    ```python
    # Good
    purpose="To research technology topics and create detailed, well-sourced reports"
    
    # Too vague
    purpose="To help with stuff"
    ```
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Tool Selection">
    Only give your agent the tools it needs:
    ```python
    # For a research agent
    tools=[*WEB_TOOLS, *FILES_TOOLS]
    
    # For an image analysis agent
    tools=[*IMAGE_TOOLS, *FILES_TOOLS]
    
    # For a data processing agent
    tools=[*FILES_TOOLS]
    ```
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Error Handling">
    Always handle potential errors:
    ```python
    try:
        processed_thread, new_messages = await agent.go(thread)
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"❌ Error: {e}")
        # Handle gracefully
    ```
