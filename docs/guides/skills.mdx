title: 'Skills & AGENTS.md'
description: 'Give your agents reusable instructions — on-demand or always-on'
---

Slide supports two complementary ways to inject instructions into your agent's system prompt:

- **Skills** — progressively disclosed on-demand via the `activate_skill` tool
- **AGENTS.md** — eagerly loaded into the system prompt at init time

Both follow open standards: [Agent Skills](https://agentskills.io/specification) and [AGENTS.md](https://agents.md).

## Skills

Skills let you package reusable instructions that agents load only when they need them. Instead of stuffing everything into the system prompt, skills keep the prompt small and focused — the agent sees a short menu of available skills and activates the ones relevant to the current task.

### How skills work

1. You point the agent at one or more skill directories
2. At init time, only each skill's **name** and **description** appear in the system prompt
3. When the agent decides it needs a skill, it calls the `activate_skill` tool
4. The full instructions from `SKILL.md` are returned to the agent as a tool result

### Creating a skill

A skill is a directory containing a `SKILL.md` file. The file has YAML frontmatter (name + description) followed by markdown instructions:

```
my-project/
└── skills/
    ├── code-review/
    │   └── SKILL.md
    └── testing/
        └── SKILL.md
```

Example `SKILL.md`:

```markdown
---
name: code-review
description: Guidelines for performing thorough code reviews
---
# Code Review Skill

## What to look for
- Correctness: Does the code do what it's supposed to?
- Readability: Is the code easy to understand?
- Performance: Are there unnecessary allocations or O(n²) loops?
- Security: Are inputs validated? Are there injection risks?

## How to format feedback
- Use inline comments for specific issues
- Summarize overall impressions at the top
- Always mention what was done well
```

#### Frontmatter requirements

| Field | Rules |
|-------|-------|
| `name` | Lowercase alphanumeric + hyphens, max 64 chars (e.g. `code-review`) |
| `description` | Plain text, max 1024 chars |

### Using skills with an agent

```python
from tyler import Agent

agent = Agent(
    model_name="gpt-4.1",
    purpose="A helpful coding assistant",
    skills=[
        "./skills/code-review",
        "./skills/testing",
    ],
)
```

The agent's system prompt will include something like:

```
# Available Skills
Use the `activate_skill` tool to load full instructions for any skill.

- **code-review**: Guidelines for performing thorough code reviews
- **testing**: Guidelines for writing comprehensive tests
```

When the agent encounters a task that matches a skill, it will call `activate_skill` with the skill name and receive the full instructions.

### Using skills with config files

```yaml
name: "MyAgent"
model_name: "gpt-4.1"
purpose: "A helpful assistant"
skills:
  - "./skills/code-review"
  - "./skills/testing"
  - "~/shared-skills/documentation"
```

Relative paths are resolved relative to the config file's directory.

## AGENTS.md

AGENTS.md files provide project-level instructions that are eagerly loaded into the agent's system prompt at init time. Unlike skills (which are progressively disclosed), AGENTS.md content is always present — making it ideal for coding standards, API conventions, and other rules that should always apply.

### How it works

1. You point the agent at one or more `AGENTS.md` files (or enable auto-discovery)
2. At init time, the file contents are loaded and placed in a `<project_instructions>` block in the system prompt
3. The agent sees these instructions on every interaction

### Creating an AGENTS.md file

Create an `AGENTS.md` file in your project root (or any directory). No special frontmatter or formatting is required — it's just markdown:

```markdown
# Project Guidelines

## Code Style
- Use type hints for all function signatures
- Follow PEP 8 naming conventions
- Prefer `async`/`await` over threads for I/O-bound operations

## Error Handling
- Always use specific exception types (never bare `except:`)
- Include meaningful error messages with context
- Use `logging` instead of `print` for diagnostics

## API Conventions
- Use `httpx` for HTTP requests (async-native)
- Always set timeouts on external calls
- Return typed dataclasses or Pydantic models, not raw dicts
```

### Using AGENTS.md with an agent

#### Explicit path

```python
from tyler import Agent

agent = Agent(
    model_name="gpt-4.1",
    purpose="A helpful coding assistant",
    agents_md="./AGENTS.md",
)
```

#### Auto-discovery

Set `agents_md=True` to automatically discover `AGENTS.md` files by walking upward from the current working directory to the filesystem root:

```python
agent = Agent(
    model_name="gpt-4.1",
    purpose="A helpful coding assistant",
    agents_md=True,
)
```

This is useful in monorepos where you might have:
```
project-root/AGENTS.md          # Company-wide rules
project-root/backend/AGENTS.md  # Backend-specific rules
```

Files are loaded root-first, so the closest file's instructions appear last (taking natural precedence).

#### Multiple files

```python
agent = Agent(
    model_name="gpt-4.1",
    agents_md=["./AGENTS.md", "./docs/coding-standards.md"],
)
```

Multiple files are joined with `---` separators.

### Using AGENTS.md with config files

```yaml
name: "MyAgent"
model_name: "gpt-4.1"
purpose: "A helpful assistant"

# Option 1: Auto-discover
agents_md: true

# Option 2: Explicit path
# agents_md: "./AGENTS.md"

# Option 3: Multiple files
# agents_md:
#   - "./AGENTS.md"
#   - "./docs/coding-standards.md"
```

Relative paths are resolved relative to the config file's directory.

### Size limits

AGENTS.md content is guarded against oversized files:
- Individual files larger than 100,000 characters are skipped with a warning
- Combined content from multiple files is truncated at 100,000 characters

If your instructions exceed this limit, consider moving task-specific content into skills instead.

## When to use which

| | Skills | AGENTS.md |
|---|---|---|
| **Loading** | On-demand (progressive disclosure) | Eager (always in prompt) |
| **Best for** | Task-specific instructions the agent may or may not need | Project-wide rules that always apply |
| **Prompt impact** | Minimal — only name + description until activated | Full content always present |
| **Format** | `SKILL.md` with YAML frontmatter | Plain markdown |

Use **AGENTS.md** for short, universal project rules that should always be in context. Use **skills** for detailed, task-specific instructions that only matter sometimes. You can use both together.
